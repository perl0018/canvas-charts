# canvas-charts

Here is a quick description of the project using "Markdown" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

This project is a pie chart and graph about countries and how much fun it is to visit them!

  * I've been to all these countries
  * Some of them are fun to visit, some of them aren't
  * The colours aren't related to anything
  
  To get the percentages, I assigned values to each country in json. 
  Using the fetch, I captured my json data in the html. 
  
  Enjoy!
